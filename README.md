# SQL-Database-Project
This project was quite enjoyable. I had a blast figuring out the logic behind creating the chart. However, once coding it started, it was...ok. 
I'm saying only ok not because it was difficult but rather it was just a lot of the same repetitive code typed out but filtered with new data. 
Though we had a group of 5 which was the largest group that I had worked with, I initially thought it was going to be quite difficult to get 
everybodies' ideas out not to mention it might be difficult to collaborate. I'm glad that my teammates were chill and everybody had the chance to 
present their ideas out loud. Wouldn't trade this group for another if I were to repeat this project again.
